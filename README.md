# All-Calculator

So this is the  calculator project in which I have drawn inspiration from other calculator.
<br>
In this calculator you will get to see two modes one is Basic mode and the another is Stat mode(Statistics).
<br>
The basic mode consist of the simple calculation as in where there is addition, division, multiplication and substraction.
<br>
But for the stat calculator i have replace those buttons with mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
<br>
so this is all of the work I put in as of i have learned.

<BR>
Hope you enjoy it!!
<br>
<br>
Note:(And there is an issue with this one which I cant solve that is when I switch the calculator to stat mode and before even entering the numbers and if I go on to click the mean button or just like other button i get to see a error where the divide, multiply or add symbol appear in the calculate div.)<br><br>
It will be helpful if some one provide me the solution.
